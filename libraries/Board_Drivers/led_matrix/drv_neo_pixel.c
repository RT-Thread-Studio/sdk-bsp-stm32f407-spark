    // each 256-element slice is equal to the first element of the next

    // discontinuities in the color wheel. So the last element of each
    // slice is dropped...we regard only elements 0-254, with item 255
    // being picked up as element 0 of the next slice. Like this:

           Repeated brightness changes using this function exacerbate the
           problem. Smart programs therefore treat the strip as a
